# Buttons
## Messing with Buttons Style

I made this a while ago after watching some of [DevTips](https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners) awesome videos.<br/>
For this project I used the Toast-Grid along with my SASS stylesheet and of course Jade (now PUG).

Also found this [http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/) while I was making this and found some great ideas there!
